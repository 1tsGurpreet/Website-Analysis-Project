   <h5>Coding is a Trap. Get Out</h5>
  
   <p>Let’s face it. Unless you are talented enough for Google to hire you, you are probably limited to developing APIs, websites, or customizing an ERP-like business system.
      If toiling day after day, adding mundane features to boring systems isn’t enough for you, you have the added task of keeping up with the frameworks and tools that will evolve with or without you. It is easy to only focus on what you are working on without building new skills. But, should you do that, it will be much harder to find work when your job is rendered obsolete.
      Chasing skills to remain economically viable is just the beginning of the trap. Coding tends to pay significantly higher than most jobs, making a move to a project management position or management position is often lateral in compensation.</p>
